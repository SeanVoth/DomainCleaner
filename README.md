# DomainCleaner


<h1>Description</h1>
DomainCleaner.ps1 is a simple yet powerful PowerShell script designed to streamline the processing of domain names from a list. Whether you're dealing with URLs or subdomains, this script ensures that your list is cleaned, normalized, and filtered down to the essential Top-Level Domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, or .net.
<br />

<h1>Features</h1>
- Extracts base domains from full URLs or subdomains (e.g., moose.cybervault7.com â†’ cybervault7.com).
- Filters and retains only domains ending in .com, .org, or .net.
- Removes duplicates and outputs a clean, normalized list.
- Overwrites the original file (domains.txt) with the processed data for simplicity.
<br />

<h1>Use Cases</h1>
- Cleaning and preparing domain lists for further analysis.
- Simplifying domain data for security tasks, like reconnaissance or threat intelligence.
- Organizing large datasets of domains by filtering out unnecessary entries.
